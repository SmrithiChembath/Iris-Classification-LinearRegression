Linear Regression from Scratch

The goal was to learn the fundamentals of supervised learning and optimization by building a working regression algorithm and applying it to the Iris dataset.



## Overview

- Dataset: `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- Task: Predict one feature from the rest using linear regression
- Methods: Custom gradient descent, batch training, early stopping
- Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE) on validation set



## Core Concepts

- Manual implementation of gradient descent for regression
- Mini-batch training with adjustable batch size
- Regularization support
- Early stopping based on validation loss
- Tracking batch-wise and epoch-wise loss
